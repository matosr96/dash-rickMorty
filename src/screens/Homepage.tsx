        <p>
          Rick Sanchez is the exact definition of "mad scientist." He's an
          alcoholic, he's a genius, he's irresponsible and he's crazy. Rick has
          just moved in with his daughter Beth and there he remembers that he
          has a grandson named Morty. Without asking anyone, he decides that he
          is going to force him to accompany him on all kinds of adventures so
          that the boy becomes smart like him and does not become an idiot like
          Jerry, Morty's father and Rick's son-in-law.
